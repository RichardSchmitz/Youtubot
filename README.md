## Issues
* Somehow a t=(timestamp) parameter got added to this video. Not sure how this could have happened... maybe they edited their comment?

* If a link is formatted and followed by a period (eg. '[title](url).') then an extra closing paren is included in the video title response (because for some reason the period and paren both match the regex, and only one is hacked out)
