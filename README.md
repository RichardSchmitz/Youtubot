## Issues

* Sometimes the bot will get its columns messed up, eg. everything will be shifted to the right one. Not totally sure why this happens - does it happen if the video title contains brackets/parentheses or a pipe? This comment had this effect: https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6f91ms/every_how_its_made_video_should_be_archived_in/digkrch/ AND it has pipes in the title.
