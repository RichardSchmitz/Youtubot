## Issues
* Somehow a t=(timestamp) parameter got added to this video. Not sure how this could have happened... maybe they edited their comment?
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/6g981z/bernie_sanders_could_have_won_thats_the_corbyn/diphhmd/?context=3

* Possibly still getting characters like ',' and ')' in URLs/ids sometimes... will need to watch for these URLs in the logs
